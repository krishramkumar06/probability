# okay THIS seems nasty.

# Write a program to simulate the times between cars when the average time between cars is 30 seconds. 
# Have your program compute an area bar graph for these times by breaking the time interval from 0 to 120 into 24 subintervals. 
# On the same pair of axes, plot the function f(x) = (1/30)e^(âˆ’(1/30)x). Does the function fit the bar graph well?
